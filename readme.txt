== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need do some setting? =

No setup needed. Just activate plugin.

= I'm having issues with categories when I'm using %postname% permalink structure =

Make sure your categories have unique slugs - watch out for post/pages with the same slugs. Normally WordPress uses the category prefix to distinguish page from a category, but with this plugin you need to make sure the slugs are unique, otherwise some pages might turn up instead of categories.

= How do I automatically redirect people from the old category permalink? =

When it comes to redirecting from the old category permalink to the new one, there is no need for any additional setup. Simply activate the plugin, and it will take care of the redirection process seamlessly. That's all you need to do! :)

= How to back the old category permalink? =

Just deactivate the plugin. That's it! :)
